What I did: I did the whole assignment myself.

‚óè What your code files are and what each one of them does. (Please do not repeat the
project description, just name your code files, and briefly mention what they do).

Code file descriptions:

Makefile - This file compiles the executables for server# and servermain where # is in {A, B, C}.

server#.cpp - The # again is in {A, B, C}, and these files are all the same apart from 2 things, which
are the values given to MYPORT (line 24), and myServer (line 63). This file is responsible for reading the
backend data files, and also for sending the student ids and departments to the main server.

servermain.cpp - The main server which initially boots up, sets up sockets to communicate to each backend server, and
requests a list of departments from each server one by one. After this point, it will ask the user to input a
department name into a query field which it will attempt to fetch from the backend server responsible.

Message format:

All my messages are sent as lists of characters separated by semicolons. There is one exception to this which is
a special command I created called '\*list' which is sent from servermain to server# which then should fetch all the
department information.

Reused Code:

A lot of my code was initially based on Beej's guide, but I made many modifications myself.
